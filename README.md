# PointToPointConnection
The project is a simulation of point to point physical layer of network. The implemented protocols are: Stop and Wait, Go Back N, Selective Repeat. There's the calculation of packet loss for each protocol in the document. Check out the document for more information about each protocol and which one worked better!
